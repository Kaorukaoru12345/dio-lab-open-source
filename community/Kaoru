Hello, I go for the pseudonym "Kaoru" in the internet, I'm currently improving my skills in react and javascript.

I have learned SQL, Javascript, React, HTML, CSS.
I'm a polygloth at japanese,english,portuguese,spanish and I'm looking forward into learning chinese.
Left my previous job so I could learn how to code to get a better salary.
